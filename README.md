# ATM Banking System (C++ - Functional Programming)

## 🧾 About

This is a simple ATM Banking System implemented in **C++**, using a **functional and procedural** approach. The application provides core banking features such as user login, quick and normal withdrawals, deposits, and balance checks — all through a console interface.

## 🎯 Features

- 🔐 User Authentication  
- 💸 Quick Withdraw  
- 💵 Normal Withdraw  
- ➕ Deposit  
- 📊 Balance Inquiry  
- 💾 File-based Data Storage  
- ⚙️ Modular Function Design  

## 📁 Data Format

Client records are stored in `Clients.txt`, with each line formatted as:

`AccountNumber#//#PinCode#//#Name#//#Phone#//#AccountBalance` — you can check this file to find valid login credentials for testing.




## 🧠 Concepts Applied

- Modular function design with clear responsibilities  
- Minimal use of global state  
- Pure data transformations and stateless processing  
- File I/O treated as data serialization/deserialization  

## 🛠 Skills Practiced

- Functional & Procedural Programming  
- File Handling in C++  
- String Parsing & Data Transformation  
- Console Application Development  
- Clean Code & Separation of Concerns  

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open the project in any C++ IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, g++)
2. Build and run the program
3. Log in using an account number and PIN
4. Navigate through the menu to perform operations

> ✅ This project was built as a self-learning exercise to explore clean and maintainable C++ design without using Object-Oriented Programming.
